# node-open-cobol

This is a wrapper method to pass COBOL code to `open-cobol` (on Linux).

It's inspired by [node-cobol](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/node-cobol) with some difference:

1. Using promise API instead of callback
2. Provide a Docker file if you are not running it on Linux
3. Change the API that make more sense
